# Manual Testing on ToolShop Application's Features

### Overview

This project focuses on the manual testing of a web-based eCommerce platform, [ToolShop](https://practicesoftwaretesting.com/).  
The objective is to verify the application's important features through structured testing to ensure accuracy, usability, and reliability.

At this stage, testing has been conducted on two key modules — the Home Page and Login functionality. These are considered essential user-facing features, forming the base for future comprehensive testing across all modules.

The work currently includes the Test Plan, Test Scenarios, and Test Cases. A Bug Report will be added soon as part of the ongoing updates.

### Deliverables

1. Test Plan – Overall testing strategy and scope  
2. Test Scenarios – Defined scenarios for major functionalities  
3. Test Cases – Positive and negative test cases for covered features  
4. Bug Report – To be added in the next update
